I'm currently an undergraduate student studying at Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics. Now. I am applying for a PhD position in statistics or biostatistics for Fall 2026.

During my undergraduate study, I am honored to work under the supervision of Professor [Lin Hou](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1056.htm) on tandem repeat phasing. This project led me into the field of statistical research. Thanks to Prof. Hou's recommendation, I went to the United States and spent a unforgettable summer at Yale University working under the supervision of Prof. [Xiting Yan](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/xiting-yan/) on bulk RNA deconvolution with platform effects removal.

My current research interests are in statistical methodological research. In particular, I am interested in probabilistic modeling and interpretable machine learning. I aim to develop novel statistical and machine learning methods that can effectively analyze complex, high-dimensional data and provide insights into real-world problems in fields such as biology, medicine, and social science.

My dream is traveling around the world to see different beautiful scenes and cultures. I am also interested in the historical and social development of my home country, [the PRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China). Additionally, [Avicii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii) is my beloved DJ: his music always encouraged me to walk out from sadness and troubles. 

My hometown is [Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing), a prosperous city in Southwestern China. I am glad that my hometown is becoming well-known around the world as a "cyberpunk city". Welcome to Chongqing!
